    "### 1.1 Concept and use-case\n",
    "\n",
    "Poincaré embeddings are a method to learn vector representations of nodes in a graph. The input data is of the form of a list of relations (edges) between nodes, and the model tries to learn representations such that the vectors for the nodes accurately represent the distances between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learnt embeddings capture notions of both _hierarchy_ and _similarity_ - similarity by placing connected nodes close to each other and unconnected nodes far from each other; hierarchy by placing nodes lower in the hierarchy farther from the origin, i.e. with higher norms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper uses this model to learn embeddings of nodes in the WordNet noun hierarchy, and evaluates these on 3 tasks - reconstruction, link prediction and lexical entailment, which are described in the section on evaluation. We have compared the results of our Poincaré model implementation on these tasks to other open-source implementations and the results mentioned in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper also describes a variant of the Poincaré model to learn embeddings of nodes in a symmetric graph, unlike the WordNet noun hierarchy, which is directed and asymmetric. The datasets used in the paper for this model are scientific collaboration networks, in which the nodes are researchers and an edge represents that the two researchers have co-authored a paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "This variant has not been implemented yet, and is therefore not a part of our tutorial and experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main innovation here is that these embeddings are learnt in hyperbolic space, as opposed to the commonly used Euclidean space. The reason behind this is that hyperbolic space is more suitable for capturing any hierarchical information inherently present in the graph. Embedding nodes into a Euclidean space while preserving the distance between the nodes usually requires a very high number of dimensions. A simple illustration of this can be seen below - \n",
    " \n",
    " ![Example tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/poincare_model_keyedvectors/docs/notebooks/poincare/example_tree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the positions of nodes represent the positions of their vectors in 2-D euclidean space. Ideally, the distances between the vectors for nodes `(A, D)` should be the same as that between `(D, H)` and as that between `H` and its child nodes. Similarly, all the child nodes of `H` must be equally far away from node `A`. It becomes progressively hard to accurately preserve these distances in Euclidean space as the degree and depth of the tree grows larger. Hierarchical structures may also have cross-connections (effectively a directed graph), making this harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no representation of this simple tree in 2-dimensional Euclidean space which can reflect these distances correctly. This can be solved by adding more dimensions, but this becomes computationally infeasible as the number of required dimensions grows exponentially. \n",
    "Hyperbolic space is a metric space in which distances aren't straight lines - they are curves, and this allows such tree-like hierarchical structures to have a representation that captures the distances more accurately even in low dimensions."
