    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to apply Doc2vec using gensim by recreating the results of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4053.pdf\">Le and Mikolov 2014</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag-of-words Model\n",
    "Early state-of-the-art document representations were based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model\">bag-of-words model</a>, which represent input documents as a fixed-length vector. For example, borrowing from the Wikipedia article, the two documents  \n",
    "(1) `John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.`  \n",
    "(2) `John also likes to watch football games.`  \n",
    "are used to construct a length 10 list of words  \n",
    "`[\"John\", \"likes\", \"to\", \"watch\", \"movies\", \"Mary\", \"too\", \"also\", \"football\", \"games\"]`  \n",
    "so then we can represent the two documents as fixed length vectors whose elements are the frequencies of the corresponding words in our list  \n",
    "(1) `[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`  \n",
    "(2) `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`  \n",
    "Bag-of-words models are surprisingly effective but still lose information about word order. Bag of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram\">n-grams</a> models consider word phrases of length n to represent documents as fixed-length vectors to capture local word order but suffer from data sparsity and high dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Word2Vec`\n",
    "`Word2Vec` is a more recent model that embeds words in a lower-dimensional vector space using a shallow neural network. The result is a set of word-vectors where vectors close together in vector space have similar meanings based on context, and word-vectors distant to each other have differing meanings. For example, `strong` and `powerful` would be close together and `strong` and `Paris` would be relatively far. There are two versions of this model based on skip-grams (SG) and continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW), both implemented by the gensim `Word2Vec` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Word2Vec` - Skip-gram Model\n",
    "The skip-gram <a href=\"http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/\">word2vec</a> model, for example, takes in pairs (word1, word2) generated by moving a window across text data, and trains a 1-hidden-layer neural network based on the synthetic task of given an input word, giving us a predicted probability distribution of nearby words to the input. A virtual <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot\">one-hot</a> encoding of words goes through a 'projection layer' to the hidden layer; these projection weights are later interpreted as the word embeddings. So if the hidden layer has 300 neurons, this network will give us 300-dimensional word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Word2Vec` - Continuous-bag-of-words Model\n",
    "Continuous-bag-of-words Word2vec is very similar to the skip-gram model. It is also a 1-hidden-layer neural network. The synthetic training task now uses the average of multiple input context words, rather than a single word as in skip-gram, to predict the center word. Again, the projection weights that turn one-hot words into averageable vectors, of the same width as the hidden layer, are interpreted as the word embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, Word2Vec doesn't yet get us fixed-size vectors for longer texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paragraph Vector, aka gensim `Doc2Vec`\n",
    "The straightforward approach of averaging each of a text's words' word-vectors creates a quick and crude document-vector that can often be useful. However, Le and Mikolov in 2014 introduced the <i>Paragraph Vector</i>, which usually outperforms such simple-averaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is: act as if a document has another floating word-like vector, which contributes to all training predictions, and is updated like other word-vectors, but we will call it a doc-vector. Gensim's `Doc2Vec` class implements this algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paragraph Vector - Distributed Memory (PV-DM)\n",
    "This is the Paragraph Vector model analogous to Word2Vec CBOW. The doc-vectors are obtained by training a neural network on the synthetic task of predicting a center word based an average of both context word-vectors and the full document's doc-vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paragraph Vector - Distributed Bag of Words (PV-DBOW)\n",
    "This is the Paragraph Vector model analogous to Word2Vec SG. The doc-vectors are obtained by training a neural network on the synthetic task of predicting a target word just from the full document's doc-vector. (It is also common to combine this with skip-gram testing, using both the doc-vector and nearby word-vectors to predict a single target word, but only one at a time.)\n",
